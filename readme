Running and Playing The Game:
______________________________

To get started, go to main1.py and run the code

Steps to play the game:

1) Customize your wordsearch by selecting the dropdown menus and press
   "Generate Wordsearch". The game interface will pop up with your wordsearch.

    *2 Text files will also be created:
        -->Word_Search.txt   *The word search in text format
        --> Word_Search_Answer_Key.txt    *The solution to the word search in text format

2) On the GUI game interface:    ***

   Look for words! Use the word bank to find words in the wordsearch

   If you have found a word, select the starting
   letter of the word and the ending letter of the word to select
   the characters in between it.

   *If the characters of the word change color, you have successfully found a word!
   It will be removed from the word list.


   *** The GUI gameplay has been proven to work on Tkinter installed on windows
